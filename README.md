## Before you install (WARNING)
1. you are gonna remove your system by installing different OS on it if you are not partitioning your drive (if you have no expirience about linux), **USE VIRTUAL MACHINES**
2. i do not guarantee that your stuff will work 100%. i am just a poor soul trying to make his own config files. :)
3. if you have any trouble, let me know on matrix channel. #klenha@matrix.org
4. i am **NOT** going to upload ISO files. building ISO files is buggy and mostly didn't work for really well, so i plan on publishing config files instead.
5. **MAKE SURE YOU EDIT THE CONFIG CALLED AUTOSTART, IT COULD FUCK YOUR MONITOR IF UR NOT 144HZ USER**
## Known issues
1. (I3 pure arch) some of the steam games may crash on startup, no idea why
2. (I3 pure arch) the PS1 (username@hostname) in terminal could be overwritten, I don't know why is it, and you fix it by not using the green colors, so removing (or commenting) the piece of PS1=... line in ~/.bashrc
3.
